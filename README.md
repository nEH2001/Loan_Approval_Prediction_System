# Loan Approval Prediction System 
This is a project in which we get to use the concept of machine learning, train and test the available dataset using the machine learning models and predict the outcomes efficiently. 
In this project the machine learning model used to train the data was "Support Vector Machine" model, which is a supervised learning model.
